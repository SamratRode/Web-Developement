        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            David Robert Joseph Beckham OBE[4] (UK: /ˈbɛkəm/;[5] born 2 May 1975) is an English former professional footballer, the
            current president & co-owner of Inter Miami CF and co-owner of Salford City.[6] He played for Manchester United, Preston
            North End (on loan), Real Madrid, AC Milan (on loan), LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and the England national team, for
            which he held the appearance record for an outfield player until 2016. He is the first English player to win league
            titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France. He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career,
            during which he won 19 major trophies.[7][8]
            <br><br>
            Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age
            17.[9] With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Champions League in
            1999.[9] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[10] winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the
            club.[11] In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy.[12] While a Galaxy
            player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer to play 100
            UEFA Champions League games.[9] In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age
            of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure.[13][14] He made 115 career appearances in total,
            appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and two UEFA European Championship tournaments,
            in 2000 and 2004.
            <br><br>
            Known for his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Beckham has been hailed as
            one of the greatest and most recognisable midfielders of his generation, as well as one of the best set-piece
            specialists of all time.[15][16] He was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or in 1999, twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of
            the Year and in 2004 was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[17][18][19] He was
            inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Premier League Hall of Fame on 20 May 2021.[20] A global
            ambassador of the sport, Beckham is regarded as a British cultural icon.[21][22]

        <h2>Manchester United</h2>

            Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,[40] Beckham was part of a group of young players,
            including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and
            helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of
            their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham
            played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's
            impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match
            against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.[40]

            Manchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they faced Leeds United. The first leg was played
            on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage.
            In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds
            United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league
            in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a
            League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at
            home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four
            in their group, behind Barcelona.[41]

            As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona[76] and the
            two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,[77] but instead he joined reigning Spanish
            champions Real Madrid for €37 million on a four-year contract.[78] Beckham was the latest signing in the Galácticos era
            of global stars signed by club president Florentino Pérez every summer.[79] The news came as a bitter blow to the newly
            elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham.[80] Though
            announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club,
            after Laurie Cunningham and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of
            500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt
            by club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano.[81] Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and
            England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was assigned to club captain Raúl. He decided to wear number 23
            instead, citing his admiration of basketball player Michael Jordan, who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason
            behind his decision.[82]

            In the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham was
            reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid, since Queiroz had spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's
            assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season
            training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's
            brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips
            to Asia during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as Beckham, however, made this
            particular tour a financial smash for los Merengues
