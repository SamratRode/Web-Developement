        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is
            a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national
            team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,
            Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has
            won 32 major trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European
            Championship, and one UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most goals (134) and assists (42) in the
            Champions League, most goals in the European Championship (14), and is currently tied with Ali Daei for most
            international goals (109). He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100 professional career
            appearances, and has scored over 780 official senior career goals for club and country.

            Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester
            United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go onto win three consecutive Premier
            League titles, the Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was
            the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a
            transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, four
            Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He also finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three
            times, behind Lionel Messi (his perceived career rival), and won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again
            in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, Ronaldo signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the
            most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two
            Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana, and a Coppa Italia in his first three seasons with the club.

            Ronaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at age 18, and has since earned over 170 caps,
            including appearing and scoring in eleven major tournaments, becoming Portugal's most capped player and his country's
            all-time top goalscorer. He scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final,
            and assumed full captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of
            all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first triumph in a major
            tournament by winning Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He
            also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer
            of Euro 2020.

            Ronaldo became Manchester United's first Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.[30] His transfer
            fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[31] Although he
            requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by
            such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona, and David Beckham.[32] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of
            motivation for Ronaldo.[33] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager Alex
            Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my
            career."[34]<br><br>

            Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003, receiving a
            standing ovation when he came on as a substitute.[35] His performance earned praise from George Best, who hailed it as
            "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[29] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a
            free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[36] Three other league goals followed in the second half of the
            campaign,[37] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also
            received his first red card.[38] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in
            United's 3–0 victory over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[39] BBC pundit Alan Hansen
            described him as the star of the final.[40] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his
            "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat a man,[41] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real
            thing", and predicted he would become a world class player.[42]<br><br>

        <h2>Real Madrid</h2>
        <div>
            Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94
            million).[106] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out
            clause.[107] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of
            75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[108] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the
            number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[109] which was presented to him by
            former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[110]

            Ronaldo made his debut in La Liga on 29 August 2009, against Deportivo La Coruña, and scored from the penalty spot in
            Madrid's 3–2 home win.[111] He scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club, the first Madrid player
            to do so.[112] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match
            against Zürich.[113] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[114][115] A week after his return, he received his first
            red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[116] Midway through the season, Ronaldo placed second in the running for
            the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year award, behind Lionel Messi of Barcelona, Madrid's
            historic rivals. He finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against
            Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in the Spanish competition.[117][118] His first season at Real Madrid ended
            trophyless.[119]
