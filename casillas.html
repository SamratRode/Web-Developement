        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            Iker Casillas Fernández (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈikeɾ kaˈsiʎas feɾˈnandeθ]; born 20 May 1981) is a Spanish retired
            professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Popularly dubbed "San Iker" ("Saint Iker") for his ability to
            produce spectacular saves, Casillas is widely regarded to be one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time.[nb 1] He is
            known for his athleticism, quick reactions and outstanding shot-stopping ability. Having spent the majority of his
            career at Real Madrid, Casillas is one of the few players to achieve over 1000 professional career matches, and holds
            the record for the most clean sheets in the UEFA Champions League, as well as for the Spain national team.

            At club level, Casillas started his career with the Real Madrid youth team, eventually gaining promotion to the main
            team in 1999, where he became the youngest goalkeeper to play in the final of the Champions League, and to win the
            title, at 19 years and four days. Casillas became the first choice goalkeeper at Real Madrid, winning two Champions
            Leagues and La Liga titles in his first three seasons, establishing himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.
            During his highly successful career in Madrid, Casillas won all major club titles, including five La Liga titles, four
            Supercopa de España titles, two Copa del Rey titles, three UEFA Champions Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups, one
            Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. After 25 years with Real Madrid, Casillas joined FC Porto in 2015 on a
            free transfer, where he won the Primeira Liga and a Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira title. While at Porto, he broke the
            record for most consecutive seasons played in the UEFA Champions League (20) and amassed the most appearances in the
            competition (177). He ended his playing career in February 2020, after almost a year on the sidelines following a heart
            attack he suffered during a training session with Porto in May 2019.
            <br><br>
            With 167 international caps, Casillas has the second most appearances for the Spain national team, making him the joint
            tenth-most capped footballer of all time. An unused substitute at UEFA Euro 2000, Casillas became the nation's first
            choice goalkeeper at the 2002 World Cup, and went on to play at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup. In 2008, he was
            made captain, and went on to lead the team to the European Championship title that year. Casillas also led Spain to
            their first World Cup win in 2010, where he kept a joint–record five clean sheets, winning the Yashin Award for the best
            goalkeeper of the tournament. Spain became the first nation to retain the European Championship, winning the title again
            in 2012, where he set the record for most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal in the competition (509). In
            2014, Casillas became one of four players to represent Spain at four World Cups.

            After much speculation about his future, on 11 July 2015 Casillas signed with Portuguese Primeira Liga side Porto on a
            two-year deal with the option of a one-year extension.[40][41][42] Real Madrid's conduct in his exit was criticised,
            with Casillas' parents claiming that he was being forced out of the club by president Florentino Pérez, who received
            calls to quit from fans. Former international teammate Xavi, who earlier that summer left Barcelona after a similarly
            long and successful career, claimed that Real Madrid were ungrateful of Casillas' service to the club.[43]
            <br><br>
            Casillas made his Primeira Liga debut on 15 August, keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 win over Vitória de Guimarães at the
            Estádio do Dragão.[44] On 29 September 2015, he overtook Xavi to become the player with the most appearances in the
            Champions League, making his record 152nd Champions League appearance in a 2–1 home win over Chelsea. That season,
            Casillas also broke Edwin van der Sar's record for the most clean sheets in Champions League history, keeping his 51st
            clean sheet in the competition on 20 October 2015, in a 2–0 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv, as his team climbed top of
            Champions League Group G.[45][46] In January 2016, he was blamed for the away loss at Vitória de Guimarães (1–0) in the
            league, following a high-profile error.[47]

            Casillas lost his place in the side to backup César Sánchez after poor performances in the 2001–02 campaign, but
            redeemed himself when Sánchez suffered an injury in the final minutes of the 2002 Champions League Final. Casillas came
            on and pulled off several key saves to deny a rampant Bayer Leverkusen the Champions League crown. Real Madrid won
            2–1.[14][15]
            conceded only 32 goals in 36 matches to claim the Zamora Trophy. On 14 February 2008, he and club captain Raúl were
            awarded contracts for life; Casillas signed a contract extension that would keep him at the club until 2017, with an
            automatic extension if he played 30 competitive matches during the final season of the contract and a buy-out clause of
            £113 million.[16] His performances earned him a spot in the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time.

            <br>
            In February 2009, Casillas equalled Paco Buyo's record of 454 matches played for a goalkeeper and has since surpassed it
            to become Real Madrid's most-capped goalkeeper of all time at only 27 years old.[17] During the 2009 summer transfer
            window, some Spanish media reported that Manchester City had launched a record £129 million bid for the goalkeeper. The
            club denied the rumours, however, saying that no such offer had been made. Manchester United had been rumoured to have
            enquired about him, but no price was announced.[18] He had been linked with other Premier League clubs before[19] but
            Casillas himself stated that he "had no intention of leaving" his boyhood club.
